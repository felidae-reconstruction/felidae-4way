We discussed data structure for experiments.
Tracks for annotation of separate genomes belong to the down-level of the
directories hierarchy of the corresponding assembly. Whereas the tracks for
alignment annotation belongs in the same way to hierarchy of alignment
experiments.
Belonging to specie is parental with respect to the date of experiment. 
We should think out the notation for naming of cactus experiments.
Cactus experiments are performed on the ucsc cluster whereas the scripts and
annotations can be executed on the mac1 (mac1.bioinf.pu.ru). The data folders
are synchronized with rsync.
Since the experiments are under the version control different users can work
in the same directory and avoid file naming conflict accurate within the
version number.
Examples:
For assemblies:
assemblies/lion/date1/track/repeats

For cactus alignments:
cactus/DHTG/data1/track/mapped_genes/date1

Dog genome masking:
Use trf for dog genome masking - donâ€™t be afraid to lose genes - the context
of repeats is exactly what should be aligned
